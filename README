cmpdism: multi-architecture comparative disassembler

cmpdism is a "comparative disassembler" targeting multiple CPU architectures. 
Its chief advantage over other disassemblers is that it is specially designed to 
be able to compare the disassembled code of different revisions of a program and 
output the differences, accounting for possible differences in addresses and 
constants between the revisions. This makes it useful for comparing prototype 
and final versions of a program, or finding differences between different 
regional releases.

Currently, the following architectures are supported:

* 6502 family:
  * MOS Technologies 6502
  * WDC 65C02
  * Hudson HuC6280

* 68000 family:
  * Motorola 68000

* SH family:
  * Hitachi SH-2

* Multi-processor instruction sets:
  * MIPS-I (coprocessor instructions currently unsupported)

Have gcc, run make. This is a bog-standard C program with no external 
dependencies, so you should be able to compile it on anything without too much 
trouble.

For basic help and options, plus a list of available disassembly architectures, 
run cmpdism with no arguments.

cmpdism's main use is comparing two different revisions of compiled program 
code. Let's say we want to compare file1.bin, which contains some binary MOS 
Technologies 6502 code, to file2.bin, which contains binary code assembled from 
a slightly modified version of the same code that produced file1.bin.

The most basic comparison is done like this:

  cmpdism 6502 -i1 file1.bin -i2 file2.bin

This will disassemble both files and print to stdout a two-column comparison 
showing the disassemblies and differences between them, with file1.bin on the 
left and file2.bin on the right.

More typically, you'll want to explicitly specify the -r and -m options 
(explained below) as something appropriate for your particular files:

  cmpdism 6502 -i1 file1.bin -i2 file2.bin -r 50 -m 1024

The program can also be run with only one input file to produce a simple 
disassembly:

  cmpdism 6502 -i1 file1.bin

For a disassembly comparison, several symbols are used to show how the code has 
changed:

* A plus (+) indicates code that was added to the second file.
* A minus (-) indicates code that was removed from the second file.
* A star (*) indicates code that was transformed (changed) from the first file 
to the second file.

Thw two most important disassembly options are -r and -m. Using them effectively 
requires some understanding of how the program works, so here's a basic 
explanation:

To deal with cases where code was added or removed in the later version, the 
program searches forward whenever it detects an opcode mismatch, trying to find 
a new positions where the two code revisions realign. The -r parameter controls 
the number of ops that must be sequentially matched in order for the opcodes to 
be considered "realigned". The -m parameter controls the number of ops that the 
program will search forward before concluding that no match exists for the 
current code (thus marking it as "changed" rather than "added" or "removed").

Essentially:
* A higher -r value makes realignment more stringent. This reduces the risk of 
the disassemblies become mistakenly realigned at an incorrect position, but 
makes it more likely that a series of small changes will be misdetected as one 
big block of changes.
* A higher -m value will better detect cases where a lot of code was added or 
removed. It increases the risk of accidental misalignment.

If you're getting massive blocks of + and - sections with a very small 
"alignment" in-between, set your -r value higher.
